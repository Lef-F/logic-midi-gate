# MIDI Gate

MIDI Gate is a [Scripter plug-in](https://support.apple.com/guide/logicpro/scripter-api-overview-lgce3905a48c/10.7/mac/11.0) for Apple's [Logic Pro](https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/) Digital Audio Workstation.

Its purpose is to cut-off any MIDI notes that are below a certain threshold velocity.
This may be useful in situations where a MIDI controller fires some unintended MIDI notes e.g. as a result of vibration in e-drums.

This plug-in was conceived together with my friend and professional audio engineer Dimitris "Frost" Sakellaris during a livestream exactly because there were additional sensors being triggered by vibrations when I was recording on my e-drums.

## Install

There's two ways to add Scripter plug-ins in your Logic Pro session:

- You can copy-paste the JavaScript code from the source file into the Scripter editor.
- You can download and install the `.pst`file (TODO: Find out how to make a `.pst` file)
